      <br>
      <p>
        Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to extract and analyze subjective information from text data. It involves the process of identifying and categorizing opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes expressed in written content, such as reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback. This analysis aims to understand the overall sentiment conveyed in the text, whether it's positive, negative, neutral, or a mix of sentiments. </p>
